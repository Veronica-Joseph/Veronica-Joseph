<h1>Hi! I'm a cybersecurity student with a growing focus on Blue Team work 🔍🛡️
Most of what I share here are TryHackMe writeups and notes from the labs I’m working through. I’m still learning and experimenting, so any advice or feedback is always appreciated 🙌
I also write on Medium about security concepts that catch my interest. If you’re curious, feel free to take a look 👇   <br/></h1>
